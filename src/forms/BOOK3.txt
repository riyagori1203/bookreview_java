I don't want to read more plagiarism comments. Every book is unique and I truly loved this book which is one of my favorite reads of 2019! Period.

Took me a while to get into this one....the beginning very much paralleled that of The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek. But as I continued to contemplate ditching it, it finally started to take a new curve and I am delighted to say, this became a much larger story.

I really enjoyed this one so thank you to a couple of Goodreads friends who likened it to The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek which made me want to read it. I love the idea of those women who set off on the backs of horses and mules to take library books to people who lived far from civilisation.
