Loved this book so much! I need another page turner, with twists like this one...any recommendations?

Wow, I'm still reeling from that ending! A mind-blowing, to-die for twist!

I was excited to pick up this psychological thriller because it has been getting some hype but it was a disappointment. Didn't care much for the characters, the twist was so obvious, the writing just okay. The only redeeming quality was the audiobook which made it possible for me to finish this book.
