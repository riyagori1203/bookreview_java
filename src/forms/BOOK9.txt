I hadn't read any of Sanghi's books before picking this up, but if his writing skills in the Krishna Key is anything to go by, then I can safely say I dodged a couple of bullets. 

"The Krishna Key" is an utter waste of time. Before I started this book I was told that the writer has two bestsellers about Christ and Chanakya in his resume`. 

- The book is packed with history, suspense, crime and emotions.
- The approach to the story/history and the character who is a scholar turned detective reminds me of Dan Brown style writing.
- The parallel running of stories of Krishna and that of the protagonist is exciting.
- The back stories and the plot twists makes the book very engaging and interesting.
