I enjoyed this book immensely! There was plenty of character driven detail about Danny and Maeve (and even Elna, in the second half) of the story. Does anyone wonder, though, what made Andrea so hateful and vindictive? She epitomizes the "evil stepmother", but what made her this way? I just wish there had been more insight into her background.


So close to be a masterpiece, a dysfunctional family story starts in this humongous, grandiose mansion, where ex inhabitants had died and left their belongings including their portraits hanging on the walls and it ends there as we move back and forth between the timelines to read the story narrated by Danny, second child of the family.Â 

This was an absorbing read even though the narrator was infuriating, self-absorbed, oblivious, selfish, and annoying.
